<h3>Exercise 1 - Write a Poem</h3>

<h4>1. Title your poem</h4>
To practice the basics of HTML, let's have you write and markup a poem. To start off with, what will the title of your poem be?

Using the (h1) tag we learned about, add a heading for your poem. This will be your title.

<h3>Exercise 2 - You can learn text tags</h3>

<h4>1. Make up the text</h4>
We've made this webpage with the words to 'You can learn anything', a video that Khan Academy made. Using both the (strong) and (em) tags that you just learned, mark up this text to show what you think should be emphasized and highlighted.

<h3>Exercise 3 - Your Learning list</h3>

<h4>1. Start a list!</h4>
What do you want to learn? A lot, I bet! Let's make a numbered list of a few of the things. Remember how to start a numbered list?
<h4>2. Add items to the list</h4>
Now that you've started the list, add items to it - at least three things you want to learn.

<h3>Exercise 4 - A picture-perfect trip</h3>

<h4>1. Add imagens</h4>
If you could take the perfect trip, where would you go? What animals would you see? What food would you eat? Add images to this webpage after each paragraph tag, to share your perfect trip with the world.
<h4>2. Resize them</h4>
We want you to experiment with the width and height attributes, so try adding them to your images.

<h3>Exercise 5 -  Links you love</h3>

<h4>1. Add links</h4>
This webpage contains a list with three empty items. Add a link in each item, pointing at one of your favorite websites.
<h4>2. Link Love</h4>
Now, below the list, turn the heart image into a link by writing the opening (a) tag before the (img) tag and writing the closing (/a) tag after it. 

<h3>Exercise 6 - Jump Around</h3>

<h4>1. Add internal links</h4>
This is a long webpage describing kangaroos, and each section heading has an id attribute. Find out what those id attributes are, and then change the href attributes of the links at the top to point at the appropriate section.
<h4>2. Add one more</h4>
There's one more link at the bottom that should link back to the top. Fix its href so that it does that.

<h3>Exercise 7 - The dinner table</h3>

<h4>1. Add rows of meals</h4>
This is a webpage to show the dinner menu for a restaurant. We've created the initial table with three columns for the meal, ingredients, and price. Now, add three rows of data to the table, one row for each meal.


<h2>Project:Recipe Book</h2>

<h3>Create a web page with your favorite recipes! 

The recipe book should have a table of contents linking to each recipe below, using internal links. Each recipe should have a table for the ingredients, a list of details, and a list and/or paragraphs of the steps required. If you use recipes from the internet, be sure to add a link to the website.

Use CSS to style the recipe book, using a mix of the simple selectors and colors that you've learned.</h3>
