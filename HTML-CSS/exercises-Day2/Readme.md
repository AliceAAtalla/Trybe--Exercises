<h2>Exercise 1 - Group the groupers </h2>

<h3> 1. Add spans</h3>
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding (span) tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your (span) tags a class called "first-sentence".

<h3> 2. Style Spans</h3>
Good! Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.

<h3> 3. Add a div </h3>
Great! Wrap the paragraphs in a single (div), and then give the div a class of "info"

<h3> 4. Style the Div </h3>
Last step! Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.

<h2>Exercise 2 - The overflowing ocean</h2>

<h3> 1. Resize the div </h3>
This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a (div).

In this first step, style the (div) that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.

<h3> 2. Make it scroll </h3>
Now, make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.

<h3> 3. Resize the img</h3>
In this last step, write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.

<h2>Exercise 3 - The boxer model </h2>

<h3> 1. Add borders <h3>
This webpage displays a gallery of photos of boxer dogs. In this first step, add a border to all of the photos. Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can.

<h3> 2. Add margin </h3>
The photos look a bit too close to each other. Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them.

<h3> 3. Add padding </h3>
The photos are too close to the side of the gallery div, and it looks weird. Add padding around all sides of the gallery div so that it looks better.
