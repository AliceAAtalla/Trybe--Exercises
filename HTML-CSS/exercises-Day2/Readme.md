<h2>Exercise 1 - Group the groupers </h2>

<h3> 1. Add spans</h3>
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding (span) tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your (span) tags a class called "first-sentence".

<h3> 2. Style Spans</h3>
Good! Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.

<h3> 3. Add a div </h3>
Great! Wrap the paragraphs in a single (div), and then give the div a class of "info"

<h3> 4. Style the Div </h3>
Last step! Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.
